# The Input function

The `input` function allows the user of a console app to enter, or *input* their own values. Here's an example:

```python
user_name = input("Please enter *your* name here: ")
print("The user's name is ", user_name)
```

>Please enter *your* name here:

When I run the program above, that text shows on my console as a prompt. Once I enter in my name and hit enter, the rest of the code will run. I end up with something like this:

>Please enter *your* name here: *Liza*\
The user's name is  Liza
